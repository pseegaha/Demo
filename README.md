#### 1) Please, sign in to unlock the overall functional app. 
#### 2) Upload any tab delimited file, the first tab "Data Structure gives the overall overview of the uploaded data" 
#### 3) and the second tab "Data Visualizer" gives the extra control or freedom for the user to plot different charts over different columns..much more like a swiss knife
